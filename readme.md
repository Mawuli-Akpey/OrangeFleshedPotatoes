# Effect of Pre-Treatment Time on Quality Characteristics of Orange Flesh Potatoes

## Dataset

## Introduction

Orange Fleshed Sweet Potatoes (OFSP) was sliced and pre-treated by blanching in hot water and ascorbic acid. Different samples were blanched at different times, 1min, 2min and 3min in each treatment. A control where no pre-treatment was applied was also included in the experiment. The samples were prepared in three triplicates and each triplicate further dried at 3 different temperatures; 50, 60 and 70C till there was very little to no noticeable change in mass. The samples were then milled and tested for different quality indices including colour, Swelling Index (SI) and Water Absorption Capacity (WAC).

## Colour

Surface color of samples was measured using a HunterLab D25 Color Difference Meter. L, a, and b values represent different properties to be recorded

L represents Luminance, ranging from 0(black) to 100(white)
a represents the green/red ratio ranging from-120(green) to 120(red)
b represents the blue/yellow also ranging from -120(blue) to 120(yellow)

## Swelling Index (SI)

Swelling Index is the volume in milliliter taken up by the swelling of one gram (1 g)of food material under specific conditions.

The starch samples (0.1g) were weighed into a test tube and 10ml of distilled water was added. The mixture of was heated to 50C in a water bath at a temperature of 50C for 30min with continuous shaking. The test tube was then be centrifuged at 1500rpm for 20min in order to facilitate the removal of the supernatant which then was carefully decanted and weight of the starch paste would be taken. The swelling power would be calculated as follows:

Swelling Power = Weight of starch paste / Weight of dry starch sample

## Water Absorption Capacity(WAC)

Water Absorption Capacity is the amount of water (moisture) taken up by food/flour to achieve the desirable consistency and create quality food product.

The starch samples (5% w/v) were rigorously agitated by hand for about two minutes. They were then dispersed in a pre-weighed centrifuge tube. The supernatant was discarded and the weight of the tube hydrated sample taken. The weight was calculated and expressed as the weight of water bound by 100g dry starch.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The analysis for this project will go through three different types of exploration; univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis
In this report we tackle key insights form our WeRateDogs dataset problem. Each insight would be
delved into with theory behind the insight and supporting graphs to enhance understanding.

Univariate analysis explores each variable in a data set, separately. It looks at the range of values, as well as the central tendency of the values. It describes the pattern of response to the variable. It describes each variable on its own.

Bivariate analysis is a kind of statistical analysis when two variables are observed against each other. One of the variables will be dependent and the other is independent. The changes are analyzed between the two variables to understand to what extent the change has occurred.

Multivariate analysis is used to study more complex sets of data than what univariate analysis methods can handle. In design and analysis, the technique is used to perform trade studies across multiple dimensions while taking into account the effects of all variables on the responses of interest.
